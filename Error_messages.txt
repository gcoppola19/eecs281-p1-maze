Everything below the line of dashes is a valid error message.
If an input is valid (not one of the INV test cases) and you
output one of these allowed error messages, the autograder
will show you the error message, which will help you with
debugging.  For example, you rejected a valid input, thinking
that we forgot the -s or --stack.  If you receive that error
message for a valid input, you know where to start debugging.

Some of these may not be in the "Errors you must check for"
section, but are still useful for debugging purposes.
